                            Low Variance Filter (Quasi-Constant Features):
                         </h2>
                         <p>
                            <strong>Feature selection</strong> or variable selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features or variables from the total features of a level in a data set to build machine learning algorithms. 
                         </p>
                 
                         <p>Quasi-constant features are those that show the same value for the great majority of the observations of the dataset. In general, these features provide little, if any, information that allows a machine-learning model to discriminate or predict a target. But there can be exceptions. So you should be careful when removing these types of features.</p> 
                         <p>
                            Identifying and removing quasi-constant features, is an easy first step toward feature selection and more interpretable machine learning models.

                         <p>
                            A brain tissue segmentation method that provides segmentations of GM, WM, and CSF is implemented. This method is applied to all 652 MR images, and the three tissue volumes are calculated for each subject.
                         </p>
                         <h2>Feature calculation</h2>
                         <p>
                            A function that calculates volume features given the three tissue volumes and the overall brain volume (which is calculated from the brain masks) is implemented. A big matrix with a row for each subject and features across the columns is constructed.
                         </p>
                         <h2>Age regression and cross-validation </h2>
                         <p>
                            Different regression methods from the sci-kit-learn toolkit are implemented. The output vector containing the age of each of the subjects is constructed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            The methods are evaluated using two-fold cross-validation where the dataset of 652 subjects is split into two equally sized sets (X1,y1) and (X2,y2) which are used for training and testing in an alternating way (so each set is used as (Xtrain,ytrain) and (Xtest,ytest) exactly once).
                         </p>
