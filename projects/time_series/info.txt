Time series is a sequence of observations recorded at regular time intervals. Time series analysis tracks the characteristics of a process at regular time intervals. It’s a fundamental method for understanding how a metric changes over time and forecasting future values. 

Time series data is used in a wide variety of fields. 

* Business: Manufacturing output, sales, prices <br>
* Economics: GDP, stock market, and other indicators <br>
* Social Sciences: Population trends, political changes <br>
* Medicine: Disease, birth, and death rates <br>
* Physical Sciences: Climate and environmental changes<br>

For this type of analysis, you can think of time as the independent variable, and the goal is to model changes in a characteristic (the dependent variable). For example:

* Hourly consumption of energy<br>
* Daily sales<br>
* Quarterly profits<br>
* Annual changes in a country’s population<br>

Autocorrelation Function

Any significant non-zero autocorrelations imply that the series can be forecast from the past. (Equals one at lag-zero)


Partial Autocorrelation Function

The 1st-order partial autocorrelation will be defined to equal the 1st-order autocorrelation.

__White Noise:__ uncorrelated random variables. 

White noise is a series of measurements, where each value is uncorrelated with previous values. 

White Noise is a series with:<br>
* Constant mean
* Constant variance
* Zero autocorrelations at all lags

* Special Case: if data has a normal distribution, then Gaussian White Noise <br>

The returns on the stock market are pretty close to a white noise process.

 Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
The augmented Dicky-Fuller tests for trend non-stationarity.

Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (beta nin 1 olmasi)(value of a =1) (series is not stationary)

Alternate Hypothesis: The series has no unit root.

If nonstationary, we need to transform it into stationary.



Time Series Models

ARIMA models, also called Box-Jenkins models, are models that may possibly include autoregressive terms, moving average terms, and differencing operations. Various abbreviations are used:

* When a model only involves autoregressive terms it may be referred to as an AR model. 
* When a model only involves moving average terms, it may be referred to as an MA model.
* When no differencing is involved, the abbreviation ARMA may be used.
* When involved, the abbreviation ARIMA may be used.
* When seasonality is involved, the abbreviation SARIMA may be used.
* When other independent variables (exogenous inputs) are involved, the abbreviation ARMAX, ARIMAX, or SARIMAX may be used.

Anomaly Detection is conducted. 

Forecasting with STL:

STLForecast simplifies the process of using STL to remove seasonalities and then using a standard time-series model to forecast the trend and cyclical components. Forecasts of STL objects are obtained by applying a non-seasonal forecasting method to the seasonally adjusted data and re-seasonalizing using the last year of the seasonal component.


Time series analysis is done using sarima model and stl forecasting is used for forecasting future data.
