Kaggle Competition (Late Submission)


1) Bike Sharing Demand: Forecast use of a city bike-share system (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)

Bike-sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people can rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems make them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike-sharing systems, therefore, function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is from the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available before the rental period.
