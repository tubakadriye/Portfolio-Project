                        <p>I worked as a Maths Teacher for about 7 years. Since I have noticed that the world has rapidly transformed with technological advancements, my interest and enthusiasm in IT-related subjects have grown. The fact that the available data in the world and the computational capacity to process them are increasing at an unprecedented speed, as well as their implications over a large span of domains ranging from the health sector to finance, has impressed me a lot. As a result, I have transitioned toward the area of Data Science. I started learning Python, Object-Oriented Programming and then continued with Machine Learning concepts. </p>

                        <p>To master my skills in this area, I applied for the master’s degree program in “Computational Science and Engineering” at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), one of the best universities in Turkey, and I got accepted. As a master’s student, I had the opportunity to learn other programming languages, including C, C++, Fortran, Octave, and Python. We have done our projects in the Ubuntu environment, which also allowed me to become familiar with shell scripting. Additionally, I had the chance to apply Parallel Computing using the C language, which was fascinating as we connected to the university’s supercomputer to do our projects. As part of my master’s program, I took a Machine Learning course from a Machine Learning lover and expert, Dr. Islem Rekik. We learned the main machine learning concepts in that course, from Linear Regression to Dimensionality Reduction. 
                        </p>  
                
                        <p>I love coding and learning new things. </p> 
                        <p>In addition to these, I am a mother and I like hiking on the Switzerland mountains with my family.</p>
